# Hi, I’m @Yikemlone

## Me
My Github account contains a few projects that I have worked on over my programming journey. I love learning new things and solving problems.
I *really* love learing new ways to solve problems.


## Languages

I’m currently learning Java, Python, C# and JavaScript. 

In my own projects I tend to use Python more as I really like that language, but I am 
more than confident in C# and Java. 

JavaScript is my weakest out of all of them, but I am working to fix that.
