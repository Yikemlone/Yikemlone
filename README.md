Finished my degree in Applied Computing. This course had lots of nerd stuff, I love it. I found a love and hatred for networking in that course. 

## About this Github
This Github account contains a few projects that I have worked on over my programming journey. I try my hands at a few different projects in languages that I want to learn better or just enjoy using.

I love learning new things and solving problems.
I *really* love learning new ways to solve problems.

## Languages
- Java
- C#
- Python
- JavaScript

In my own projects I tend to use Python more as I really like that language, but I am 
more than confident in C# and Java.
