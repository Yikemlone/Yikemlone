# Hi, I’m Michael

I am currently a student in College right now, doing a degree in Applied computing. Lots of nerd stuff, I love it. I found a love and hatred for networking in this course.

## About this Github
<br>

This Github account contains a few projects that I have worked on over my programming journey. I try my hands at a few different projects in languages that I want to learn better or just enjoy using.

I love learning new things and solving problems.
I *really* love learning new ways to solve problems.

## Languages
<br>

I’m currently learning Java, Python, C# and JavaScript. 

In my own projects I tend to use Python more as I really like that language, but I am 
more than confident in C# and Java. 

JavaScript is my weakest out of all of them, but I am working to fix that.
